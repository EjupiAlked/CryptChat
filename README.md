# CryptChat
> CryptChat is a secure chat between an Android client and Java server based on TCP/IP socket connection.

This chat uses the Diffie-Hellman algorithm for the exchange of public keys and the AES algorithm for the encryption/decryption of messages. The public keys carries different parameters which can be seen by anyone , they are needed to generate a common secret key. Both client and server generate a key pair, the public key mentioned before and private key used to decrypt every message. The common secret key (generated by the Diffie-Hellman algorithm) encrypts the messages. Encrypted messages that are sent over the socket are encoded in BASE64.

## Motivation
This personal project was created in my final year of high school in 2017. I presented this project during my oral exam which was about Computer Security. After high school my coding skills have improved, that's why I decided to refactor the code making the chat more secure. 

## Project Status

This project is currently in development.
